# Sudoku
It is my first ever mini project on python using backtracking method to solve puzzles.
This project is a Python-based Sudoku Solver that uses the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. The solution process is displayed in real-time through a Tkinter GUI, allowing users to visualize each step as the algorithm fills in the grid.

Features

Backtracking Algorithm: Uses recursion to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently.
Tkinter GUI: Displays the Sudoku grid and updates in real-time, showing each step of the solving process.
Interactive Visualization: Users can see how the algorithm fills each cell, making it an educational tool for understanding backtracking.
